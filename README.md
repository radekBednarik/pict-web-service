# PICT web service

Simple backend and frontend tooling for generating
test cases using [PICT](https://github.com/microsoft/pict) under the hood.

When used correctly, this tool should provide you with
`.json`, `.txt`, `.csv` and `.xlsx` options to download generated test cases.

## Installation

Read these:

- [backend](/backend/README.md)
- [frontend](/frontend/README.md)

## Deployment

Application is currently available on [Render domain](https://pict-web-service-frontend.onrender.com/).
This is temporary solution.

Also, please note, that we are using free tier of Render service,
which results in slow spin up of the backend server and first response
of the backend can take over half a minute.
